        Pharmaceutical companies have normalized prescribing pills as the main treatment for majority of diagnoses. This has resulted kids as young as those who are still learning how to develop cognitive skills to be exposed to pill medication. Since finding the most effective medication for each individual is a process of trial and error, consuming so many different types of medication can lead to dangerous side effects. Furthermore, there have been many cases of misdiagnoses and kids are forced to deal with the repercussions of it. The sad reality of today is that while kids are still learning to recognize shapes, they are already learning to recognize pills.
