            <p>I came up with three ideas: CAPTCHA images, movie posters of films that have won Academy Awards, and dog breeds.</p>

            <p>I have furthered my collection of CAPTCHA images by cropping into individual low-res photos.</p>

            <p>I am giving my collection to Mia. I have curated 11 groups of CAPTCHA photos with more than 100 photos total. They are random in which some groups ask for the user to pick which ones are oranges or have mountains in them or fire hydrants.</p>

            <h2>Part 4</h2>
            <p>I have filtered the photos in three different ways. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AmYTufLFsep1HxA_se0xUulRid4i4R2K?usp=sharing">first way</a> is sorted through the subject of the photo. The main three groups within this filter is determined if it is a food, nature, or part of a neighborhood/city. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1osWIhfI1XFLQg18zpiVPvP35ufAyqk5s?usp=sharing">second filter</a> is sorted through colorful photos and not colorful photos. Most of the photos that follow the color category are pictures of food or fire hydrants. The photos that are considered not colorful are usually cropped photos of roads or are in mainly muted tones. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ITsh10kR5a5nSnLd0v_i6-ea5Meu3Owv?usp=sharing">third filter</a> is separated into different colors. Based on the color that encompassed the majority of the photo, I grouped the photos based on the colors: red, brown, blue, green, yellow/orange, and gray.</p>
