            <p>I came up with three ideas: CAPTCHA images, movie posters of films that have won Academy Awards, and dog breeds.</p>

            <p>I have furthered my collection of CAPTCHA images by cropping into individual low-res photos.</p>

            <p>I am giving my collection to Mia. I have curated 11 groups of CAPTCHA photos with more than 100 photos total. They are random in which some groups ask for the user to pick which ones are oranges or have mountains in them or fire hydrants.</p>

            <p>I added more to the collection that I was given by my partner, Yeong Ju. Among the other categories of pills, I added oral contraceptives to the collection. A few ways I can filter these groups can be by the purpose of using it such as all of these pills are for diabetes, pain relief, anemia, high blood pressure, and more. Another way to categorize these is buy the colors. All the same pills of a similar shade can be grouped together. A third filter can be through the shape of the pill. Some are circular, some capsules are in a cylinder shape, some are rounded rectangles, and more. </p>

            <h2><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/2a8O2Lfx2lvfIKczuUpRvv/Elastic-Collections?node-id=0%3A1">Part 5</a></h2>
            <p>
                In the link above, I have designed a prototype for this project on Figma. I have decided to sort the pills through their purposes and their shape.
                In the first design, each section of the pills have their own column and the user can scroll down to see a vertical carousel of the pills organized according to shape. If the user scrolls horizontally, they will also see the different sections such as Amnemia, HBP, Depression, etc. Additionally, the user can click on each pill and the name of it will pop next to it.
                In the second design, I have the website set up as files as if a doctor was sifting through different tabs of a file. The pills are sorted through shape as well in methodical grids.
                Lastly, the third design shows all the pills all thrown together on the grid and overlapping each other. It is satisfying to see some of the pills disappear in accordance to what type of pills you choose in the drop down menu. The user can also hover on top of the medication and it will reveal the name of it.
