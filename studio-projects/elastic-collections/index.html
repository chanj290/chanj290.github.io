            <p>I came up with three ideas: CAPTCHA images, movie posters of films that have won Academy Awards, and dog breeds.</p>

            <p>I have furthered my collection of CAPTCHA images by cropping into individual low-res photos.</p>

            <p>I am giving my collection to Mia. I have curated 11 groups of CAPTCHA photos with more than 100 photos total. They are random in which some groups ask for the user to pick which ones are oranges or have mountains in them or fire hydrants.</p>

            <p>I added more to the collection that I was given by my partner, Yeong Ju. Among the other categories of pills, I added oral contraceptives to the collection. A few ways I can filter these groups can be by the purpose of using it such as all of these pills are for diabetes, pain relief, anemia, high blood pressure, and more. Another way to categorize these is buy the colors. All the same pills of a similar shade can be grouped together. A third filter can be through the shape of the pill. Some are circular, some capsules are in a cylinder shape, some are rounded rectangles, and more. </p>
