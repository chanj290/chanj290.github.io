           <ol>
                <li>I chose the text Going with the Flow by Eleanor Morgan. It addresses hormones and women's bodies, and it was originally published on The Gaurdian. The author first observes the women of all ages around her. She realizes that they all have one thing in common: how their reproductive systems have affected their lives. Morgan confronts how society has gone about addressing periods, menopause, and everything women go through in a hush-hush manner. She is unapologetic in her voice in writing. She empowers women by destigmatizing the side effects women face from menstruation and by correcting the myths and misinformation on it.</li>
                <li>Through my design, I would like point out to my readers the voice that Morgan carries throughout her writing. As unapologetic she is, I want my typography to be bold and to stand out. Having text overlap and creating an unconventional grid, this design choice can allude to going against social norms on how society views women's repoductive systems. I could also experiment with playing with the flow and bleed of the typography which references periods.</li>

                    <p>For this concept, wherever the mouse hovers over the words, the text will either shake, merge, blend or overlap. I haven't decided exactly what motion the text will make yet, but this motion is in reference to "bleeding" and "flow."

                    <p>For this idea, the landing page and when the page is idle, the title of the reading will cover the entire screen in an organic, flowy typeface. When the site is able to detect movement in the mouse or when scrolled, the title will fly to the corners of the screen, revealing the body text. This bold typography alludes to the tone of voice of the author: unapologetic and confrontational.

                <h3>Art Direction 3</h3>
                    <img src="direction3.jpg" class="responsive">
                    <p>As you read the text, the background has gradient color blobs that move as you scroll or move around the website. Meanwhile, the title emulates a lava lamp in its shape and movement as it bounces in a liquid manner vertically on the screen. This is inspired by the topic of menstruation and flow.
