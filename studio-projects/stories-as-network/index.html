                <li>I chose the text Going with the Flow by Eleanor Morgan. It addresses hormones and women's bodies, and it was originally published on The Gaurdian. The author first observes the women of all ages around her. She realizes that they all have one thing in common: how their reproductive systems have affected their lives. Morgan confronts how society has gone about addressing periods, menopause, and everything women go through in a hush-hush manner. She is unapologetic in her voice in writing. She empowers women by destigmatizing the side effects women face from menstruation and by correcting the myths and misinformation on it.</li>
                <li>Through my design, I would like point out to my readers the voice that Morgan carries throughout her writing. As unapologetic she is, I want my typography to be bold and to stand out. Having text overlap and creating an unconventional grid, this design choice can allude to going against social norms on how society views women's repoductive systems. I could also experiment with playing with the flow and bleed of the typography which references periods.</li>
