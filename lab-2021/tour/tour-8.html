        <h1>You make it to the concourse.</h1>
        <p>There are signs that indicate which direction to go to depending on which exit you are looking for. A sign with different streets and landmarks pertaining to each exit are posted on a pillar in the station. People are walking very quickly left and right. It feels like if you can't decide where you're going soon, you'll be run over by a stampede of people.</p>
