            <p>The Mass Transit Railway (MTR) is a major public transport network serving Hong Kong. It encompasses 11 heavy rail lines and 98 stations that circulate through the three urbanized areas in Hong Kong: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. Although each rail line have their own official names, they are often referred to their colors. For example, the Tsuen Wan line is referred to the red line.</p>
