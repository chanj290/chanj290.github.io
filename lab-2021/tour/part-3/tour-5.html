            <p>Thankfully, there are unoccupied seats. If this was during rush hour, there would be a swarm of people. All of the seats would be taken, while the designated seats in red would be reserved for the elderly, disabled, or pregnant women. When people go to work or get off work, the trains are usually packed with people, leaving you feeling claustrophobic with no personal space.</p>

            <p>As you shuffle over to find a seat, you pass by elderly women with grocerries from the wet market poking out from their trolley, a few college students finishing up some homework on their iPad, and a majority of passengers passing time on their phones. Everyone seems a little tired so it is relatively quiet, accompanied by train ambience.</p>
