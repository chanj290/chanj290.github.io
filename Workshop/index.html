      Ghada's online habits include scrolling through Tiktok's For You Page. She'll often share memes or funny videos to her friends on that platform. On Instagram, she scrolls through her feed, click through stories, and occasionally look through classmates's profiles. She also uses the video calling app, Botim, to call her mom back in Abu Dhabi.
